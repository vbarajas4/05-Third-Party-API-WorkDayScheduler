## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Project Outline

In this project I was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Moment.js library was used to work with date and time, this allowed it to display the day at the top of the daily planner.

Bootstrap and fontawesome was used to help create the timeblocks for standard business hours. Each timeblock of the day is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
If a user click into a timeblock then the user can enter an event
and click the save button to save the text for that event in local storage.
